# semiconductor-wafer-alignment-HMI
This project simulates an automated semiconductor wafer alignment and counting system using Raspberry Pi logic in Proteus and a real-time HMI dashboard built with Node-RED. The system detects wafer alignment using a laser–LDR sensor setup, controls a motor for correction, and displays live status, alarms, and wafer count .
